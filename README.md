Project: ToDo List from TheOdinProject

This is the tenth project assigned by The Odin Project. The purpose of this assignment was to apply OOP principles especially "Single Responsbility Principle" during code creation. It focuses on organizing our code in the most effective way so it had us our seperate DOM manipulation/UI code from the logic code.
